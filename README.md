## Description

WordPress 4.9.6 added a few tools to help you creating and displaying a privacy policy or assist with requests for exporting/erasing personal data.  
Depending on your location or type of install (the tools may not be suitable for Multisite or large networks), you may have already taken measures to comply with existing privacy laws or/and you do not need them at all.

With this plugin, all the new admin screens will be disabled to prevent cluttering your admin with more unused items. It also prevents showing you the feature pointer if you install this plugin before the update.
